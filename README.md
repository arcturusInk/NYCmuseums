# NYCmuseums
Provide users with information regarding the many museums in NYC

### PROJECT DETAILS:
NYCmuseums – built on Layar’s API – came about after working as a undergraduate summer researcher at POLY. Since I could not share the research with others – as the project was the professor’s idea I was working under – I created NYCmuseums (my own idea) using the programming skills I had learned during the summer. The purpose of the app is to provide users with information regarding the many museums in NYC. The photos below explains what the application does.
