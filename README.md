# NYCmuseums
Provide users with information regarding the many museums in NYC

### PROJECT DETAILS:
NYCmuseums – built on Layar’s API – came about after working as a undergraduate summer researcher at POLY. Since I could not share the research with others – as the project was the professor’s idea I was working under – I created NYCmuseums (my own idea) using the programming skills I had learned during the summer. The purpose of the app is to provide users with information regarding the many museums in NYC. The photos below explains what the application does.

### SCREENSHOTS OF NYCMUSEUMS:

The application can viewed be in augmented or mapped interface – as seen in the pictures. In the augmented interface, each black dot represents a museum. The closer the museum is from your location, the larger the dot. After a museum is selected, a description box pops up and gives the name of the museum, its address, a brief description of what the museum displays and how many miles you are away from the selected museum.

After the “More Information” link is clicked, it gives the user a link to the selected museum’s website and queries the database to get the museum’s phone number, hours of operation and admission fees. The second photo depicts how the app takes you to the museum’s website.

The “Take Me There” link, takes you to Google Maps. It gives directions to the museum from your location.
